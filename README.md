# lbcnn
This is a implementation of a local binary convolutional layer using TensorFlow. 

This code is inspired by [this article](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1608.06049).

# How to
1. The file [DNN x CNN x LBCNN.ipynb](https://github.com/PedroAntonioFS/lbcnn/blob/main/DNN%20x%20CNN%20x%20LBCNN.ipynb) has a example of local binary neural network. It trains diferents models to classify images of clothing and compares the accuracy of the them. The example has 3 neural networks: a dense neural network, a traditional convolutional neural network and a local binary convolutional neural network;
2. To learn more how to use [lbcnn.py](https://github.com/PedroAntonioFS/lbcnn/blob/main/lbcnn.py) in your code, see the [Tutorial](https://github.com/PedroAntonioFS/lbcnn/wiki/Tutorial) and [Documentation](https://github.com/PedroAntonioFS/lbcnn/wiki/lbcnn).
